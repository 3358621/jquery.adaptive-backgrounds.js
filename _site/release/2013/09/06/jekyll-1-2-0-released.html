<p>After nearly a month and a half of hard work, the Jekyll team is happy to announce the release of v1.2.0. It&#8217;s chock full of bug fixes and some enhancements that we think you&#8217;ll love.</p>

<p>Here are a few things we think you&#8217;ll want to know about this release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>jekyll serve --detach</code> to boot up a WEBrick server in the background. <strong>Note:</strong> you&#8217;ll need to run <code>kill [server_pid]</code> to shut the server down.</li>

<li>You can now <strong>disable automatically-generated excerpts</strong> if you set <code>excerpt_separator</code> to <code>&quot;&quot;</code>.</li>

<li>If you&#8217;re moving around pages and post, you can now check for <strong>URL conflicts</strong> by running <code>jekyll doctor</code>.</li>

<li>If you&#8217;re a fan of the drafts feature, you&#8217;ll be happy to know we&#8217;ve added <code>-D</code>, a shortened version of <code>--drafts</code>.</li>

<li>Permalinks with special characters should now generate without errors.</li>

<li>Expose the current Jekyll version as the <code>jekyll.version</code> Liquid variable.</li>
</ul>
