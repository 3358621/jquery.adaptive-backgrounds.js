<p>It&#8217;s been about six weeks since v1.2.0 and the Jekyll team is happy to announce the arrival of v1.3.0. This is a <strong>huge</strong> release full of all sorts of new features, bug fixes, and other things that you&#8217;re sure to love.</p>

<p>Here are a few things we think you&#8217;ll want to know about this release:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You can add <a href='/docs/datafiles/'>arbitrary data</a> to the site by adding YAML files under a site&#8217;s <code>_data</code> directory. This will allow you to avoid repetition in your templates and to set site specific options without changing <code>_config.yml</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You can now Run <code>jekyll serve --detach</code> to boot up a WEBrick server in the background. <strong>Note:</strong> you&#8217;ll need to run <code>kill [server_pid]</code> to shut the server down. When ran, you&#8217;ll get a process id that you can use in place of <code>[server_pid]</code></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You can now <strong>disable automatically-generated excerpts</strong> if you set <code>excerpt_separator</code> to <code>&quot;&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you&#8217;re moving pages and posts, you can now check for <strong>URL conflicts</strong> by running <code>jekyll doctor</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of the drafts feature, you&#8217;ll be happy to know we&#8217;ve added <code>-D</code>, a shortened version of <code>--drafts</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Permalinks with special characters should now generate without errors.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Expose the current Jekyll version as the <code>jekyll.version</code> Liquid variable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
